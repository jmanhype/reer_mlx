# Feature Specification: REER × DSPy × MLX Social Posting Pack

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-the-reer`  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build the REER × DSPy × MLX Social Posting Pack"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse X (Twitter) analytics data
   ’ If no data: ERROR "No analytics data available"
2. Extract posting strategies via REER (Reverse-Engineered Reasoning)
   ’ Mine latent strategies from historical top posts
   ’ Store as append-only traces (seed params + score)
3. Build DSPy pipeline with phases:
   ’ Ideate: Generate content ideas
   ’ Compose: Create post content
   ’ Package: Format for platform
   ’ Schedule: Determine optimal timing
   ’ Seed: Initial distribution
   ’ Tend: Monitor and optimize
4. Configure LM backend routing
   ’ Parse flags: dspy::<provider/model> or mlx::<model>
   ’ Route to appropriate provider
5. Validate against frozen schemas
   ’ Check traces.schema.json compliance
   ’ Check candidate.schema.json compliance
   ’ Check timeline.schema.json compliance
6. Evaluate performance metrics
   ’ Measure impressions-per-follower uplift
   ’ Calculate cost reduction vs cloud-only
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If schema adherence < 90%: ERROR "Schema validation failed"
   ’ If provider switching requires code edits: ERROR "Non-flag provider change"
8. Return: SUCCESS (pipeline ready for deployment)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an indie builder or growth team member, I want to analyze my successful X (Twitter) posts to extract patterns and generate new optimized content that follows proven strategies, while maintaining flexibility in choosing between cloud-based AI providers for speed or local MLX processing for cost savings.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CSV export of X analytics data, **When** I run the REER mining process, **Then** the system extracts posting strategies and stores them as append-only traces
2. **Given** extracted posting strategies, **When** I request new content generation, **Then** the DSPy pipeline produces optimized posts following the Ideate’Compose’Package’Schedule’Seed’Tend workflow
3. **Given** a configured system, **When** I switch from cloud provider (e.g., OpenAI) to local MLX via flag only, **Then** the system continues generating content without code modifications
4. **Given** generated content over 30 days, **When** I measure performance, **Then** impressions-per-follower show e15% uplift vs baseline
5. **Given** identical scoring tasks, **When** comparing MLX local vs cloud-only costs, **Then** MLX achieves e50% cost reduction

### Edge Cases
- What happens when analytics data is incomplete or corrupted?
- How does system handle rate limits from cloud providers?
- What occurs when MLX hardware is unavailable on non-Apple Silicon?
- How does the system recover from interrupted trace mining?
- What happens when schema validation fails during runtime?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST normalize X (Twitter) analytics data into JSONL format
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract latent posting strategies using REER methodology and persist as append-only traces
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement a six-phase DSPy pipeline (Ideate’Compose’Package’Schedule’Seed’Tend)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support provider switching via flags only (dspy::<provider/model> or mlx::<model>) without code changes
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate all data against frozen schemas (traces.schema.json, candidate.schema.json, timeline.schema.json)
- **FR-006**: System MUST achieve e90% schema adherence in continuous integration
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide audit trails for all generated content and strategy decisions
- **FR-008**: System MUST support hybrid cloud + local operation for cost/performance optimization
- **FR-009**: System MUST achieve e15% uplift in impressions-per-follower compared to baseline
- **FR-010**: System MUST reduce scoring costs by e50% when using MLX vs cloud-only operation
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain black-box module design allowing single-person ownership
- **FR-012**: System MUST support GEPA/optimizer tuning using trace-derived supervision

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **REER Trace**: Append-only record containing seed parameters and scores from historical post analysis
- **Post Candidate**: Generated content awaiting optimization and scheduling
- **Timeline Entry**: Scheduled post with metadata for tracking and performance measurement
- **Strategy Pattern**: Extracted posting strategy derived from REER analysis
- **LM Provider Configuration**: Settings for routing between DSPy cloud providers and MLX local processing
- **Performance Metrics**: KPI measurements including impressions, engagement, and cost calculations

## Assumptions & Dependencies
- Access to X (Twitter) analytics data in exportable format
- Availability of cloud LM providers (Together, OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace)
- Apple Silicon hardware for MLX local processing (optional but recommended)
- Historical post data sufficient for meaningful pattern extraction

## Out of Scope (v1)
- Building a full posting scheduler or CRM system
- Guaranteeing specific engagement metrics (optimization only)
- Multi-platform support beyond X (Twitter)
- Real-time streaming analytics processing
- Custom model fine-tuning beyond GEPA optimization
