## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from tools.memory_profiler import memory_profile, setup_memory_limits

# Setup monitoring
setup_memory_limits(alert_mb=1000, critical_mb=2000, cleanup_mb=1500)

# Profile functions
@memory_profile()
def process_data(data):
    return [x * 2 for x in data]
```

### Advanced Monitoring
```python
from tools.memory_profiler import start_memory_monitoring, get_memory_profiler

# Start background monitoring
start_memory_monitoring()

# Profile model loading
profiler = get_memory_profiler()
model = profiler.profile_model_loading("my_model", load_model_func)
```

### Optimized Trace Processing
```python
from core.trace_store import REERTraceStore

store = REERTraceStore(path)

# Memory-efficient querying
async for trace in store.lazy_query_traces(min_score=0.5, limit=1000):
    process_trace(trace)

# Get stats without loading all traces
stats = await store.get_memory_efficient_stats()
```

## Performance Impact

- **Memory monitoring overhead**: < 1% CPU usage
- **Profiling decorator overhead**: ~0.1ms per function call
- **Streaming operations**: Constant memory usage regardless of data size
- **Background monitoring**: Minimal impact with configurable intervals

## Configuration Options

The system supports extensive configuration through environment variables:

```bash
export REER_MEMORY_ALERT_MB=1000
export REER_MEMORY_CRITICAL_MB=2000
export REER_MEMORY_CLEANUP_MB=1500
export REER_MEMORY_MONITORING_INTERVAL=30
export REER_MEMORY_PROFILING_ENABLED=true
```

## Emergency Procedures
